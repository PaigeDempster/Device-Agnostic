Like Morris Benton before him, Middleton*<br>
was a modest man who spent his working life designing for<br> 
one manufacturer, in his case the Ludlow Typograph<br> 
Company of Chicago; he was also their design<br> 
director, and made largely on his own the decisions<br> 
that were needed about what faces to cut to keep up<br> 
with a market which was hungry for type. Middleton<br>
and Ludlow mostly kept to the paths trodden by other<br>
manufacturers, but the faces they produced were<br> 
of very high quality.<br>

The Ludlow machine cast solid line slugs, but it<br>
worked from hand set brass matrices, and was used<br>
almost exclusively for advertising display work and<br>
newspaper headlines. One particular characteristic<br>
was that it sometimes used matrices slanted at an<br>
angle of seventeen degrees from the vertical, so that<br>
its italics gave the appearance of being kerned without<br>
in fact being so.<br>

Middleton was born near Glasgow in Scotland on<br>
6 May 1898, and emigrated to the United States at<br>
the age of ten, when his father went to manage a coal<br>
mine in Alabama. A few years later the family moved<br>
to Illinois, and Middleton went to the Chicago Art<br>
Institute with the intention of becoming a painter.<br>
However, he soon came under the sway of Ernst<br>
F. Detterer, a teacher greatly influenced by the<br>
European private press movement, who had studied<br>
briefly with Edward Johnston, and now set up a new<br>
curriculum at the Institute devoted to the printing<br>
arts. Detterer had been commissioned by the Ludlow<br>
Company, then only seventeen years old, to design a<br>
type using the same Jenson model at the other<br>
foundries had followed, with such faces as Benton's<br>
Cloister for ATF, after the example set by the private<br>
presses. Although Detterer took as his model the<br>
same book, Jenson's *Eusebius*, as Rogers had used for<br>

    <p>Centaur, and employed the same engraver, Robert<br>
Wiebking, his face, called Eusebius (1924) was far<br>
closer to the older Cloister. The young Middleton<br> 
collaborated on the roman, designed the italic on his<br>
own, and so impressed Detterer with his abilities that<br>
the latter recommended him for a job with Ludlow.<br>
He began there in 1923, became director of type<br>
design in 1933, and retired in 1971; during that time<br>
he produced nearly a hundred faces.<br>
The Ludlow machine was relatively cheap, and<br>
easy to operate, and was widely used, especially after<br>
its faces became known for their quality, in small<br>
shops which could not afford a Linotype. Huge<br>
numbers of matrices were needed, and Middleton<br>
was greatly helped to begin with by Robert Wiebking,<br>
who not only made punches and matrices but had<br>
designed his own pantographic machine for doing so,<br>
and taught him much about the technical requirements<br>
of matrices for practical everyday types.<br>
The types Middleton produced were for the most<br>
part handsome workhorse faces which followed<br>
current fashion: Ludlow Black (1924) was modelled<br>
on Oswald Cooper’s Black (1921) for Barnhart<br>
Brothers&amp;Spindler, and Cameo (1927) was an inline<br>
roman like Tiemann’s Narziss for Klingspor (1921).<br></p>
