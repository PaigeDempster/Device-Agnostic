Like Morris Benton before him, Middleton* <br>was a modest man who spent his working life designing for <br> one manufacturer, in his case the Ludlow Typograph <br> Company of Chicago; he was also their design<br> director, and made largely on his own the decisions that were needed about what faces to cut to keep up with a market which was hungry for type. Middleton and Ludlow mostly kept to the paths trodden by other manufacturers, but the faces they produced were of very high quality.
The Ludlow machine cast solid line slugs, but it worked from hand set brass matrices, and was used almost exclusively for advertising display work and newspaper headlines. ONe particular characteristic was that it sometimes used matrices slanted at an angle of seventeen degrees from the vertical, so that its italics gave the appearance of being kerned without in fact being so.
Middleton was born near Glasgow in Scotland of 6 May 1898, and emigrated to the United States at the age of ten, when his father went to manage a coal mine in Alabama. A few years later the family moved to Illinois, and Middleton went to the Chicago Art Institute with the intention of becoming a painter. However, he soon came under the sway of Ernst F. Detterer, a teacher greatly influenced by the European private press movement, who had studied briefly with Edward Johnston, and now set up a new curriculum at the Institute devoted to the printing arts. Detterer had been commissioned by the Ludlow Company, then only seventeen years old, to design a type using the same Jenson model at the other foundries had followed, with such faces as Benton's Cloister for ATF, after the example set by the private presses. Although Detterer took as his model the same book, Jenson's *Eusebius*, as Rogers had used for

<p>Centaur, and employed the same engraver, Robert Wiebking, his face, called Eusebius (1924) was far closer to the older Cloister. The young Middleton collaborated on the roman, designed the italic on his own, and so impressed Detterer with his abilities that the latter recommended him for a job with Ludlow. He began there in 1923, became director of type design in 1933, and retired in 1971; during that time he produced nearly a hundred faces.<br>
The Ludlow machine was relatively cheap, and easy to operate, and was widely used, especially after its faces became known for their quality, ini small shops which could not afford a Linotype. Huge numbers of matrices were needed, and Middleton was greatly helped to begin with by Robert Wiebking, who not only made punches and matrices but had designed his own pantographic machine for doing so, and taught him much about the technical requirements of matrices for practical everyday types.<br>
The types Middleton produced were for the most part handsome workhorse faces which followed current fashion: Ludlow Black (1924) was modelled on Oswald Cooper’s Black (1921) for Barnhart Brothers&amp;Spindler, and Cameo (1927) was an inline roman like Tiemann’s Narziss for Klingspor (1921).</p>
